Given a right circular cone inscribed in a hemisphere where the base of the cone coincides with the base of the hemisphere. We need to find the ratio of the height of the cone ($h$) to the radius of the hemisphere ($r$).

Since the cone is inscribed in the hemisphere, $h$, $r$, and $r$ form a right triangle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

$$h^2 = r^2 + r^2$$

Simplifying, we have:

$$h^2 = 2*r^2$$

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

$$h = \sqrt{2}*r$$

Hence, the ratio of the height of the cone to the radius of the hemisphere is $\sqrt{2}:1$.

The answer is $$\boxed{(D) \sqrt{2}:1}$$.
